Can I get admission in bed on 62 aggregate,"The admission policy at NED University is an open merit scheme. Students with the higher numbers can choose any department, therefore as the number of students pick their seats, the departmental quotas started finishing and that is how the eligibility criteria is determined. It means that one cannot predict exactly how much numbers are required to get into a particular department, because this criteria is decided by the students of that particular year. Apart from open-merit system there are Self-Financing seats too, but there is also pretty healthy competition, which means you will still have to score better numbers."
Should we go for scope or interest?,"The scope of your career cannot define your success in that career. Choose a field where your heart lies and the scope will be created for it over time. When we choose the field we love, enjoy and have an interest in, we would not bunk to work or study in that desired field instead work harder and perform our best."

Details about the different departments and distinctions between them (like what are the differences between SE and BSCS and CIS?),"There are 25 plus departments in NED University. You can find details about each department on respective departmental site. Software engineering is a field largely concerned with the application of engineering processes to the creation, maintenance, and design of software for a variety of different purposes. Computer science takes a broad approach to the study of the principles and use of computers that covers both theory and application. This field involves the understanding and application of both abstract and concrete knowledge. The study of Computer Information Systems (CIS) focuses on the practical applications of computer technology through the study of a broad range of subjects. Professionals in this field may have knowledge and expertise in topics such as software design, communications or business. They are the experts to turn to when it comes to applying technology to business applications."

Why one should study computer system engineering ,A degree in computer engineering gives you the foundational skills needed to pursue a career in coding or computer programming. It gives you a good understanding of the theory behind the processes involved in creating computer programs and applications.
Why one should study electrical engineering,"Electrical and electronic engineers work at the forefront of practical technology, improving the devices and systems we use every day. From solar-energy systems to mobile phones, we innovate to meet society's communication, tech and energy needs."
Why one should study mechanical engineering,"If you have a passion for Mathematics and Physics, you can choose to study mechanical engineering because it will help sharpen your skills in the design, research and manufacturing of equipment, aircraft and other vehicles. It will also hone your analytical and logical thinking skills."
Why one should study civil engineering,Civil engineering makes a tangible difference to people's lives. This has to be the number one reason why civil engineers believe their chosen career is the best. Many of the projects they work on are for the benefit of the general public and local communities.
Why one should study urban engineering,"Urban Engineers provide physical definition of the urban habitat, by planning, designing, building/constructing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure including buildings and roads. The development of sustainable and functionally dependable urban habitats is the need of community. "
Why one should study electronic engineering,"Electrical and electronic engineers work at the forefront of practical technology, improving the devices and systems we use every day. From solar-energy systems to mobile phones, we innovate to meet society's communication, tech and energy needs."
